## FOCUS AREA 3.5 (Select and Use Resources)

<br>
Educators have their pedagogy and processes in delivering learning concepts. As Pre-Service Teacher, I wish to use ICT to improve and enhance teacher-centered instruction in delivering learning content to students. However, articles published in the Australasian Journal of Educational Technology (AJET, 2021) suggest Pre-Service Teachers may need more guidance, modeling, and understanding of technology-based pedagogy. Therefore, as a Pre-Service teacher, I will make this a learning objective for myself on my upcoming practicum and into the workplace.

On this webpage, I have ICT resources and handouts useful for Educators while simultaneously applying Bloom’s Taxonomy Model of Thinking. As a result, students gain problem-solving capabilities, decision-making, creative expression, and empirical reasoning. (The Australian Curriculum, 2022). Additionally, ‘Assessment 1’ satisfies The Australian English Curriculum Links, where students use technology in a combination of text, video, audio to interact and navigate globalized issues. (The Australian Curriculum, 2021). Please find below a scaffolding timeline that compliments Bloom’s Taxonomy Model while incorporating ICT Resources for Assessment 1.
