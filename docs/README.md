## FOCUS AREA 2.6 (Information Communication and Technology)


<em> How does ICT Improve student’s literacy skills within the English Classroom?</em>


The Teacher describes how information and communication technology is a tool that can transform the delivery of learning and content within the classroom. The introduction of and the use of ICT can enable teachers to assign students tasks, break down focus questions and use multimodal texts to understand social issues and ideas within an everchanging world. (AITSL, 2021).
Students are exposed to several different multimodal texts and various prose within the English Classroom. Assigning students to analyze and develop their multimodal texts such as newspaper articles, blogs and visual debates can be helpful to assess a student’s punctuation, sentence structure, and tone. (Fazzi & Cuestas, 2020). In a world of globalization and advanced technological changes, teachers need to adapt and lead a paradigm shift in the teaching-learning -process. More than ever, students are exposed to current affairs and social reforms that are now delivered on a social media platform. Within the premise of the classroom, it is therefore essential for the Teacher to acknowledge students’ prior knowledge and facilitate inferential thinking in analyzing social ideas and issues within our world.



## Blooms Taxonomy and ICT Learning in the English Classroom.

Bloom’s Taxonomy compliments ICT use within the classroom, particularly in studying multimodal texts. The Blooms Taxonomy Model exercises students’ Higher Order Thinking Skills and Lower Order Thinking Skills. (Husain, 2021)
 
Students can CREATE their Media Constructs within the English Classroom. Teachers are encouraged to expose students to different media texts through close reading and ANALYSIS. Part of Bloom’s Model of Taxonomy in Thinking is to ensure students UNDERSTAND a concept before they REMEMBER it (Husain, 2021)
 
Once a student has understood how language features are used to construct a multi-media text, students have an opportunity to APPLY language features to the prescribed topic question and issue.
