## FOCUS AREA 4.5 (Using ICT Safely, responsibly and ethically) 

<br>
The need for Technology is ever-growing amongst Australian Schools and within the Australian Curriculum. The Australian Curriculum Outcomes for Digital Technologies state that digital Technologies are essential for sharing ideas and information online, taking into account safety, social contexts, and legal responsibilities (E-safety Commissioner, 2022). Therefore, Secondary School Teachers must highlight online behaviours and actions that can cause legal consequences amongst Secondary School students. The benefit of using Menti.com is an anonymous platform where students can reveal their answers to a quizzical question without other students knowing their answers. Using Menti.com in the classroom means that student efficacy is maintained while allowing teachers to formatively assess students' knowledge on ICT Safety and Responsibility
<br>
<br>
